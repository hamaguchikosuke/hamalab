  description: Animals learn to predict environmental changes, but prediction is a difficult behavior to test. We established a simple yet reliable behavior task (Reward10) to induce predictive behavior in mice. By combining two-photon Ca imaiging and novel reinforecement learning model-based analysis, we found secondary motor cortex plays a critical role to make a predictive choice.
